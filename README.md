A Web Extension to *snooze* tabs and windows now and have them reopen automatically later.

Features:
- Snooze individual tabs, selected tabs, or full windows in just two clicks
- Configure keyboard shortcuts and context menu options to snooze tabs even quicker
- View your currently sleeping and already awoken tabs in the nap room
- Edit Sleeping Tabs to wake up at a different time, Snooze woken up tabs again
- Works completely offline - None of your data is transmitted anywhere, and the extension is entirely self contained

I initially built this for myself. Had too many tabs open at the end of the day, and didnt want to look at them until work started the next day.
