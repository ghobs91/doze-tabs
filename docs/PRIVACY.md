No other data is collected. Your snoozed urls, geolocations, ip addresses and even languages have never, and will never be used in any way.

You can open your Network tab in your Browser inspector and see exactly what is being sent to the server. If you snooze a tab for monday at 4:15pm, the string `monday.1615` will be sent over to the server. That's it.

You may turn this off on the settings page of your extension.
